## 🧠 First-Time Setup Tips

### 📥 Download Fish Speech Model (one-time)

To use **Fish Speech**, you must download the model checkpoint from Hugging Face. This requires a Hugging Face account and access token.

### 🔐 Step-by-Step:

1. **Create an account (if needed):**
   [https://huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join)

2. **Get your access token:**
   Visit [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and create a **read token**.

3. **Log in via CLI:**

   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```

   Paste your token when prompted.

4. **(Optional)** Accept the model license:
   Visit [https://huggingface.co/fishaudio/openaudio-s1-mini](https://huggingface.co/fishaudio/openaudio-s1-mini) and click **"Access repository"** if prompted.

5. **Download the model:**
